### How do I run the tests?

To run the test suite, use one of the following npm scripts:

```bash
# Run the test suite
npm test

# Run the test suite in watch mode (recommended during development)
npm run test:watch

# Update Jest snapshots
npm run test:update

# Run the test suite and generate a code coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Where should I place new tests?

Place `*.test.jsx` files in the same directory as the corresponding component. Example:

```
src/
  Icon/
    Icon.jsx
    Icon.test.jsx
    ...
```
