# Introduction

Toolbox is a library of components and design guidelines for iFixit and Dozuki. Our goal is to create a system that enables us to build consistent and accessible user experiences with ease, yet with enough flexibility to support both iFixit and Dozuki.

This style guide is living documentation that will be updated as we continue to improve and evolve our design system.
